Overview
========

  ratekeeper is a kernel module that implements the ratekeper link bandwidth
  guarantee mechanism for multi-tenant data-centers.

  The mechanism enforces dynamic rate assignments by combining egress and ingress 
  traffic control at the end machines with packet drops and explicit feedback 
  notifications. It also imposes egress rate limits on remote senders through a 
  distributed control protocol.


Build Details
=============

  Before the ratekeeper module can be built, iproute2 and act_mirred.ko must be
  patched and installed.  See instructions below on how to do this.

  Note that configure may refuse to build if it considers your linux kernel 
  too new or too old. If you know what you are doing, you can override this 
  check by passing --force.


How to compile this
===================

1. iproute2

- Download the appropriate version of iproute2 package source code

Download:
    http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/net/iproute2/
Repository:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git

- Apply the provided patch, then compile and install

cd iproute2-version
patch -p1 < <RK_DIR>/patches/iproute.patch
compile and install iproute2

(requires bison, flex, libdb-dev)

2. act_mirred.ko

- Download the appropriate act_mirred.c source code for your kernel version

Download:
    https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/plain/net/sched/act_mirred.c

- Apply corresponding patch, then compile and install

3. uthash

The ratekeeper daemon uses a hash table to maintain the state of each monitor 
that is in the ratekeeper recovery phase. Ratekeeper currently uses uthash
as its underlying hash table implementation.

4. libnl, libnl-genl

The libnl suite is a collection of libraries providing APIs to netlink protocol based Linux kernel interfaces.
