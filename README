Overview
========

  ratekeeper is a kernel module that implements the ratekeper link bandwidth
  guarantee mechanism for multi-tenant data-centers.

  The mechanism enforces dynamic rate assignments by combining egress and ingress 
  traffic control at the end machines with packet drops and explicit feedback 
  notifications. It also imposes egress rate limits on remote senders through a 
  distributed control protocol.


Build Details
=============

  Before the ratekeeper module can be built, iproute2 and act_mirred.ko must be
  patched and installed.  See instructions below on how to do this.

  Note that configure may refuse to build if it considers your linux kernel 
  too new or too old. If you know what you are doing, you can override this 
  check by passing --force-act-mirred-ver.


How to compile this
===================

1. iproute2

Download the appropriate version of iproute2 package source code

Download:
    http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/net/iproute2/
Repository:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git

2. act_mirred.ko

The provided configure/make will attempt to download the appropriate act_mirred.c 
source code for your kernel version and apply the corresponding patch. 

configure
make

Otherwise you can manually download the appropriate act_mirred.c version
from the following url and apply the corresponding patch (located in
<RK_DIR>/patches/act_mirred.patch:

Download:
    https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/plain/net/sched/act_mirred.c

3. Compile and install

cd iproute2-version
patch -p1 < <RK_DIR>/patches/iproute.patch
compile and install iproute2

(requires bison, flex, libdb-dev)

3. uthash

The ratekeeper daemon uses a hash table to maintain the state of each monitor 
that is in the ratekeeper recovery phase. Ratekeeper currently uses uthash
as its underlying hash table implementation.

Download:
    http://uthash.sourceforge.net/
Repository: 
    git://github.com/troydhanson/uthash

uthash is a header file only, there is no library code to link against.
Copy the uthash.h header file located in the /src directory into /usr/include/

4. libnl, libnl-genl

The libnl suite is a collection of libraries providing APIs to netlink protocol based Linux kernel interfaces.

Download:
    http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/

Compile and install

3. make

make
sudo make -j5 install

Sometimes proxy configurations can prevent the automatic download and patch
of the act_mirred.c file.  If you are running behind a proxy and encounter this problem, 
the following command might help instead:

sudo sh -c "export https_proxy=$https_proxy; make -j5 install"

4. Configure interface

Configure the physical NIC the ratekeeper service will use (the NIC traffic
from the different VMs will be sent/received on).  To do this, set the RK_PNIC
variable in the /etc/default/ratekeeper configuration file.

5. Start the Ratekeeper Service

/etc/init.d/ratekeeper start
